This is a good game that you definitely don't want to miss. It is based on the revision of the classic game, but it is more fun, more pure, more casual and more suitable for brain exercise.

The rules of the game are very simple, that is, the number is chosen to fall to the right place, and the same adjacent numbers are merged.

Try to challenge higher scores and beat other players on the leaderboard!
