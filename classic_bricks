   Plates of different shapes consisting of small squares fall from the top of the screen one after another. Players can make one or more complete pieces at the bottom of the screen by adjusting the position and direction of the blocks. These complete bars will then disappear, making room for the new fallen plate, while the player receives a score award.

   Blocks that have not been removed are piling up. Once they are stacked at the top of the screen, the player loses and the game ends.
